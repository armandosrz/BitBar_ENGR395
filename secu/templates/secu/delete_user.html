<h3>Closing your account</h3>

<p>At Bitbar, we value all our users and we would be really sad to see you leave. However, if for some reason you need to close your account, please confirm that you are <strong>{{users}}</strong> and click on the button below.</p>

<p>Please note that once deleted, we will not be able to restore your account.</p>

<form action={% url 'secu.views.close' %} method="post">
  <input class="pure-button button-primary" type="submit" value="I confirm that I want to close my account" />
</form>
